This repository consist of several notebooks related to NLP technique.
NLP is Natural Language processing a part of Data science deals with textual data.We are surrounded by lots of data which we ignore whether we speak,hear and read its that kind of data which consist alphabates,numbers,special character. By using NLP technique we can seggregate those unstructured data into structured form that we can use for Data analysis.

We learn NLP from basics to advance step by step.

## Start Learning !!!!!

1.Data Prepration
This notebook includes cleaning and preprocessing of data.
2.Semantic Search
**1. Semantic textual similarity (STS)** — comparison of sentence pairs. We may want to identify patterns in datasets, but this is most often used for benchmarking.
**2.Semantic search** — information retrieval (IR) using semantic meaning. Given a set of sentences, we can search using a ‘query’ sentence and identify the most similar records. Enables search to be performed on concepts (rather than specific words).
**3.Clustering** — we can cluster our sentences, useful for topic modeling.
